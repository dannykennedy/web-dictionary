# Njamed.com static website generator

## Usage

* cd into /public
* run python3 formatter.py ../mini-dictionary-for-website.txt
* This will format the .txt file into HTML, and add the header and links to the included JS files. 
* Deploys automatically from master to netlify, so take care!
* (or, use the script to output HTML for your own suitably formatted shoebox file. Just change the styling please!)
