Jill via Andy: Mankange or mankangekanj is the inner bark used for fish poison made by peeling the outer bark from manbarlarra (owenia) and scraping the wood underneath, then pounding it then throwing it into a water body to poison fish. The word also refers to wood scraped from another small shrub found in the stone country (Jill will ask Marlene for the name) - but in that case the mankangekanj is mixed with leaves and bark before being used as fish poison. But mankange / mankangekanj also refers to any inner bark used for making string eg from manbudbud.

\nt DK: Jill wrote that she would spell this 'behke' and Kdj dictionary spells it this way, but I hear a retroflex myself. Jill explained that there are two purposes of 'berhke', cleansing and increasing. MG- other people have indicated the third sense, as suggested by the illustrative sentence. The berhke spelling is typical of Kuninjku and Kune dialects. Kunwinjku does not usually put a retroflex sound before the glottal stop e.g. kunkih vs kunkirh, wohnan vs worhnan etc. Evans discusses these dialect differences as ‘adglottal retroflexion’ on page 113 of his grammar.

Carroll AIATSIS files have "Kole marn-bom, wanj mey rowk bornrdok mankole kunmadj-bernel madj-bernel-mey bene-dolkang wam". Jill says that 'bernel' is the handle of the bag, but I couldn't elicit any natural uses of the word outside bernelmang and bernelkan. Jill mentioned "kunyarlbernel", as the "string handle of the bag", which is probably similar to 'kunmadj-bernel' in the Carroll text.

\ee Spangled grunter are common in rocky creeks and were caught by spearing them with pronged fishing spears. Because spangled grunter are small fish and they are often found in shallow rocky watercourses, a special technique for spearing them was to lower the spear into the water and wait for a large one to approach the end of the spear. The fish was then speared with a jabbing motion. This avoided the spear being thrown in from above the water and hitting the rock below which damaged the prongs requiring much time and effort to repair them.

\xe In the old days our ancestors used to make shovel-nosed wooden hunting spears called fi:lulumarra, similar to fi:barrawu spears. They would make the spear tip from special types of tree, then break off part of another tree for the shaft, and attach it. They would stick beeswax on (to hold it together), the wax would harden and they would hunt with it.
\so Jill Nganjmirra
\nt DK: Jill said that 'barrawu' these days usually refers to a spear with a steel tip, whereas lulumarra is strictly wooden. "Shape like mandjawak". Apart from that I'm not sure what the difference is. Jill says manlombelng would be a common tree for the tip, and mandjoh could be used for the shaft.

\nt DK: I would guess this is an adjective, based on Jill's example sentence and the fact that it's a kind of antonym to 'miledubbe'. Jill described this as 'light one', e.g. a man might discourage his wife from wearing a light dress or top because it was a bit see-through. I tried to elicit other uses of -karrkarr but this mght be the only one. MG- It’s also recorded in the main file as an adjective, but because it contains the noun mile- it is really a nominal compound ‘open weave textile/lightly woven textile’ or miledubbe ‘tightly woven textile’. The -karrkarr and -dubbe parts are I guess adjectives.

\nt DK: Etherington has 'nin - wren', and Evans/'How to write Kundjeyhmi' has nin - grass wren' and 'nin - small bird sp'. Is it possible the word is more generic than double-barred finch? MG- There is only one grasswren in the WAL/Kakadu area and that is the white-throated grasswren and it is called Yirlingkirrkkirr. For Etherington to say “wren” is not precise enough because there is no such bird called “wren” and the white-throated grasswren is never called ‘nin’. The only candidate would be Fairy-wrens but they are called ‘dalkkedalkken’. If it is also a generic name for small birds, then which ones, because there are other words for “small bird” such as kikkik.

MG- that’s not true from my observation in the ceremony over some decades, as the men who wear the white headbands in the Kunabibi are all called warehware, some of whom may have seen the ceremony many times. Warehware are those who “go inside” the ceremony and who cannot reappear until the end. An initiate seeing the ceremony for the first time will be both ware and kulawuddul. In my experience, the first timers are called kulawuddul. The Kunabibi was only brought to Kunbarlanja in the 1950s at the request of Ronald Berndt and Kunwinjku people are not as familiar with it compared to people further to the east and south-east.

\de In trouble, marked as a criminal or wrongdoer. 
\ee This originally referred to people who had been marked out for traditional punishment or revenge, for example because they made a major mistake during a ceremony. It now refers to people marked for punishment by non-Indigenous law as well, for example people when someone has a warrant out for their arrest.

\de Break the law, make oneself a criminal.  
\nt DK: I’d never heard this word. Etherington’s dictionary has wowarreworrinj - became a criminal, but the thesis transcriptions only have wowarremen. Jill says "yiwowarre" means something like "you're in serious trouble". If mankole kabindiyame, kunekke ngarriyime. If there's a ceremony, and people make a mistake, people say "birriwowarreminj", that family who made the mistake is in trouble. If someone has an arrest warrant out on them, the same word is used.

\nt DK: original translation was “so we can possess the truth”, but that didn’t quite make sense to me”. Also kunmakmak was translated at righteousness.

After that, they would invite women to eat the kangaroos that the boy speared (the first kangaroos speared by a young man are traditionally taboo for women to eat).

\nt DK: Jill says this should be "yibarlirrng", though the 'ng' at the end is very swallowed. "Manbudbud kunyarl, or manbornde. Yibarlirrng nakka nakimuk." Big string bag. Etherington has dillybag (string bag for shoulder). Andrew also calls it a string bag, but spells it “Yibarlirr”, e.g. “Yibarlirr string bag benmenekang benmenekurrmeng dja wam kunrerrng fire wood dja kunwardde kunkerri mangihmangi”. In the Literature Production Centre story above, the illustration seems to be of the kind of knotted string bag with loose diamond weave that people make sometimes. In Kunwinjku Spirit there is also “Benmenedahkendoy kore yibarlirr”, when Mongerrk puts the two sisters in his dilly bag. So I think it’s most generic than the Barabba clan estate, but is this the same type of dilly bag meant in that context?]

\so Quoted in Etherington, Steve, ‘Learning to be Kunwinjku: Kunwinjku people discuss their pedagogy’, PhD Thesis, Charles Darwin University, 2006
\nt DK: I would say this is transitive, unless yimiwon and yimowon are different. There seem to be plenty of transitive examples like ‘kanyimowon’ above. E.g. “Yidjirdmang njale kore Balandakenh kunkarre, yimarnebakke wanjh ngundukkang. Kabidjurrkkan nabuyika nawu karrurrkmirri ngunmang ngunyimowon yiyolyolme. - When you steal anything under Balanda law, you break that law, and they’ll handcuff you. They’ll send another man who works there and he’ll grab you and take you inside to testify.” (Etherington thesis). ’Do’ and ‘go’ seem to be related general words here, referring to the manner in which something happens - like in English “The rock went ‘splash’”. But there are examples where it seems to mean ‘go’ even more clearly, like “Wanjh benemwam benemyimowong kondah Koyek, benemwam benedanginj beneyerrkang benengadkaruy bobebmeng manboyahwurd.” (Andrew). Jill prefers yimowon.

\nt DK: I understand from Jill that the ceremonial example sentence refers to the tools themselves, rather than the bag (probably in a similar way that we use 'toolbox' in English to imply the contents of the toolbox, set of skills etc). Jill translated 'kunyirrk' as "tools for ceremony". She says "bu on kayime ceremony, all the tools kabirribebbebke", then after the ceremony they put them back into the string bag. Perhaps it's a general way to refer to tools carried in a string bag.

\xv When a child is very young, people take wet sand from underneath flowing water and rub it on its chest. That's so when the child grows up, he will always stay happy, and won't get sad and down - as if water is flowing in his heart.

\de Fluid ooze out.
\xv Yowyowmeng rowk wanjh berlngdanj rowk wanjh birrimirrhkudjmey.
\xe The fluid all oozed out and then the swelling all went down and then they took out the sharp splinter.
\nt DK: Jill says kaboyowyowme is the correct spelling. 'The Language of Emotions', Maïa Ponsonnet's book about Dalabon, has "kangeyowyowme? Belly-flows (feel good)". Jill wouldn't use this word itself, but says that happiness and 'flowing' are associated 'kakangemak yiman kayime kukku kayowyowme.', just as unhappiness and 'blockage' are associated (njilngkurduhme, etc). People "Mix sand and kukku from running water.", and as they rub sand on the child's chest, people will say "bu yidjordmen yikangemakmen..." etc.
