\de Bleed.
\nt Second sense from ‘Bininj Kunwok talk about health’. Andrew also has this sentence, but in trying to translate it I found that maybe he meant to refer to refer to korlobok as having red eyes rather than doddorok? “Doddorok kabenekukrohrok korlobok dja ngahli doddorok ngalengman kuwarde kani kaluk ngalmimkurlba bu karrinan kare kore kuwarde karriwardebidbun karrikawon karrolkan ngalwelbang bu karrolkan kare kayerrkan kore kubolkbuyika manwardebuyika.” There is also this [xv] in this dictionary - ‘Mankoy kabirribimbun, yinan bim yiman kunkurlba. - They paint red pictures the colour of blood.’ Jill notes that the kk version should be ‘kunkurradj’. Andrew’s Kunbalak book also has this spelling.

Jill says “kabibun” would be the western Kunwinjku way to say it, kabiwe is the eastern formulation.

Jill says "yiwowarre" means something like "you're in serious trouble". If mankole kabindiyame, kunekke ngarriyime.

And when he speared a third kangaroo, they would put the bones in the bag again and deposit the bag in a cave. After that, they would invite women to eat the kangaroos that the boy speared (the first kangaroos speared by a young man are traditionally taboo for women to eat). 
\so Jill Nganjmirra
\nt DK: Jill says this should be "yibarlirrng", though the 'ng' at the end is very swallowed. "Manbudbud kunyarl, or manbornde. Yibarlirrng nakka nakimuk." Big string bag. Etherington has dillybag (string bag for shoulder). Andrew also calls it a string bag, but spells it “Yibarlirr”, e.g. “Yibarlirr string bag benmenekang benmenekurrmeng dja wam kunrerrng fire wood dja kunwardde kunkerri mangihmangi”. In the Literature Production Centre story above, the illustration seems to be of the kind of knotted string bag with loose diamond weave that people make sometimes. In Kunwinjku Spirit there is also “Benmenedahkendoy kore yibarlirr”, when Mongerrk puts the two sisters in his dilly bag. So I think it’s most generic than the Barabba clan estate, but is this the same type of dilly bag meant in that context?]

They’ll send another man who works there and he’ll grab you and take you inside to testify.” (Etherington thesis). ’Do’ and ‘go’ seem to be related general words here, referring to the manner in which something happens - like in English “The rock went ‘splash’”. But there are examples where it seems to mean ‘go’ even more clearly, like “Wanjh benemwam benemyimowong kondah Koyek, benemwam benedanginj beneyerrkang benengadkaruy bobebmeng manboyahwurd.” (Andrew).
