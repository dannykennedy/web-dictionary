\re fish spear
\de 'Fish wire' spear, wire. Spear with three or four sharpened metal prongs at the end, used for fishing or hunting smaller animals such as aquatic birds. A similar spear with barbed wooden prongs is known as <i>mandanj</i> and is considered to be the more traditional prototype for <i>mandanj</i>. 
\xv Bolkkime nawu djalakiradj karrimarnbun nawu balanda marnbom <i>wire</i>. Karridjobke karrimarnbun dad danjbik kunubewu kunkarrngbakmeng nawu <i>wire</i> dad. Karrimang mankole wanjh karridadname nawu dad djalakkiradj.
\xe These days we make fishing spears out of wire, a non-indigenous material. We cut it and make three or four prongs, then we cut spear shafts and fasten the prongs onto them. 
\so Andrew Manakgu, Injalak Arts painting documentation. 
\cf mandanj
\bw Evans writes that this comes from Malay "tali kəras" meaning "taut line". "This would presumably refer to the way in which the string holding the prongs in place must be pulled taut". Yolngu Matha = djalakaritj 'spear with long thin steel prongs, used for fishing' Jill says it with a "k" sound, so says it should be kkiradj.

The roots of the ironwood tree <i>Erythrphloeum</i> chlorostachys are dug up and broken off. They are then heated over a fire and the resin or gum will exude. The exudate is collected on a stick or rock until it has been exhausted. The resin is highly toxic and the extraction is conducted away from domestic areas.

\nt DK: Had a go at fleshing out this entry with examples. Etherington textbook splits the meaning into two senses as well, but his second [sn] is phrased as 'links the verb to a reason or person being talked about'. This might be more accurate than mine, not sure. He also used 'marnebebme' as an example of this second sense, as well as 'birrimarnedurrinj  = they were arguing about (that particular issue)'

\nt Jill notes that she would spell this without retroflex 'rn' ("mun-dik-kan, kammundikkan, yimundikka"). Above LAAL text does not use retroflex. Jill also says that this should be "around the forehead", not around the neck "kore kumilh kabirrikurrme, kawelwelme kore kubodme bedberre" (otherwise it would strangle people). The illustration in the LAAL text above though does have people carrying the bags around their neck though, with them hanging at their backs.

Jill says "kabibun" would be the western Kunwinjku way to say it, kabiwe is the eastern formulation.

It now refers to people marked for punishment by non-Indigenous law as well, for example people when someone has a warrant out for their arrest.

\nt DK: I'd never heard this word. Etherington's dictionary has wowarreworrinj - became a criminal, but the thesis transcriptions only have wowarremen. Jill says "yiwowarre" means something like "you're in serious trouble". If mankole kabindiyame, kunekke ngarriyime. If there's a ceremony, and people make a mistake, people say "birriwowarreminj", that family who made the mistake is in trouble. If someone has an arrest warrant out on them, the same word is used.

\nt DK: Jill says this should be "yibarlirrng", though the 'ng' at the end is very swallowed. "Manbudbud kunyarl, or manbornde. Yibarlirrng nakka nakimuk." Big string bag. Etherington has dillybag (string bag for shoulder). Andrew also calls it a string bag, but spells it "Yibarllirr", e.g. "Yibarllirr string bag benmenekang benmenekurrmeng dja wam kunrerrng fire wood dja kunwarde kunkerri mangihmangi". In the Literature Production Centre story above, the illustration seems to be of the kind of knotted string bag with loose diamond weave that people make sometimes. In Kunwinjku Spirit there is also "Benmenedahkendoy kore yibarlirr", when Mongerrk puts the two sisters in his dilly bag. So I think it's most generic than the Barabba clan estate, but is this the same type of dilly bag meant in that context?]

\nt DK: I would say this is transitive, unless yimiwon and yimowon are different. There seem to be plenty of transitive examples like 'kanyimowon' above. E.g. "Yidjirdmang njale kore Balandakenh kunkarre, yimarnebakke wanjh ngundukkang. Kabidjurrkkan nabuyika nawu karrurrkmirri ngunmang ngunyimowon yiyolyolme. - When you steal anything under Balanda law, you break that law, and they'll handcuff you. They'll send another man who works there and he'll grab you and take you inside to testify." (Etherington thesis). 'Do' and 'go' seem to be related general words here, referring to the manner in which something happens - like in English "The rock went 'splash'". But there are examples where it seems to mean 'go' even more clearly, like "Wanjh benemwam benemyimowong kondah Koyek, benemwam benedanginj beneyerrkang benengadkaruy bobebmeng manboyahwurd." (Andrew). Jill prefers yimowon.
